/**********************************************************************
 *  Using Percolation with QuickFindUF.java, give a formula (using tilde
 *  notation) for the running time (in seconds) of PercolationStats.java
 *  as a function of N and T.
 *
 *  Be sure to give the leading coefficient.

/**********************************************************************
 *  After reading the course collaboration policy, answer the
 *  following short quiz. This counts for a portion of your grade.
 *  Write down the answers in the space below.

2.

1. How much help can you give a fellow student taking COS226?
(a) None. Only the preceptors and lab TAs can help.
(b) You can discuss ideas and concepts but students can get help
    debugging their code only from a preceptor or a lab TA or
    a student who has already passed COS226.
(c) You can help a student by discussing ideas, selecting data
    structures, and debugging their code.
(d) You can help a student by emailing him/her your code.

2. What are the rules when partnering?
 (a) You and your partner must both be present while writing code.
     But after that only one person needs to do the analysis.
 (b) You and your partner must both be present while writing code
     and during the analysis but after that only one person
     needs to be present while submitting the code and the
     readme.
 (c) You and your partner must both be present while writing code,
     during the analysis and while submitting the code and the
     readme. Failure to do so is a violation of the course
     collaboration policy.
